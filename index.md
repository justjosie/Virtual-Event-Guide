### Welcome Qiskitters

## Overview
This guide provides relevant resources and guidance as you plan a qiskit hackathon at your university. We have included IBM-specific ideas and guidance to help fill out your event and make it as successful as possible.
 
The term “your event” is used on purpose. Although IBM is more than happy to sponsor or support, at the end of the day this event is owned by you and your group of collaborators. We are here to help and support you along the way. As a qiskit-themed event, there are a few rules that we’d like to see put into place. If your group is on board, we’ll send swag, prizes, and even IBM Researchers as mentors and guest judges.
 
One good principle to always follow – **the most successful events have a theme**. Gaming, chemistry, exploring new algorithms, and adapting classical approaches are all themes we’ve seen before. You can, and should, adapt one of those for your hackathon, or create something entirely new.
 
A second helpful principle – **clearly state the roles** between your team of organizers, our IBM team of supporters, and the participants at your event. We like to think of it like a sports team. You and your team are the Head Coaches. You make the decisions on where, when, and who is joining. You control final say over pretty much all aspects, but you take guidance from other sources. We see ourselves at IBM as the assistant coaches, here to help where you need it, but reluctant to step on your toes. We organize the IBMers to stop by, and deal with some of the smaller details that must be managed. Finally, we look at the participants as the athletes. At the end of the day, they’re the entire reason for the event! Making sure they stay happy and engaged is crucial to the success of the entire team, and we all should work together to achieve that goal.
 
Let’s go team!
