# Welcome Qiskitters

## Overview

This guide provides relevant resources and guidance as you plan a qiskit hackathon at your university. We have included IBM-specific ideas and guidance to help fill out your event and make it as successful as possible.
 
The term “your event” is used on purpose. Although IBM is more than happy to sponsor or support, at the end of the day this event is owned by you and your group of collaborators. We are here to help and support you along the way. As a qiskit-themed event, there are a few rules that we’d like to see put into place. If your group is on board, we’ll send swag, prizes, and even IBM Researchers as mentors and guest judges.
 
One good principle to always follow – **the most successful events have a theme**. Gaming, chemistry, exploring new algorithms, and adapting classical approaches are all themes we’ve seen before. You can, and should, adapt one of those for your hackathon, or create something entirely new.
 
A second helpful principle – **clearly state the roles** between your team of organizers, our IBM team of supporters, and the participants at your event. We like to think of it like a sports team. You and your team are the Head Coaches. You make the decisions on where, when, and who is joining. You control final say over pretty much all aspects, but you take guidance from other sources. We see ourselves at IBM as the assistant coaches, here to help where you need it, but reluctant to step on your toes. We organize the IBMers to stop by, and deal with some of the smaller details that must be managed. Finally, we look at the participants as the athletes. At the end of the day, they’re the entire reason for the event! Making sure they stay happy and engaged is crucial to the success of the entire team, and we all should work together to achieve that goal.
 
Let’s go team!

## Intro to Virtual Event Opportunities  (Josie)
There are a lot of opportunities to create, host, or participate in virtual events. Virtual events remove the physical-interaction from the activity, which can make them unique experiences with a slightly different approach to planning. With virtual events on the rise, we wanted to offer our resources and guide for how you may be able to optimize your own virtual event! 

### What are virtual events? 
Virtual events are online events where people interact in a virtual environment online, rather than gathering in a physical location. It may sound limiting, but there are quite a few options for exciting virtual events that not only can reach a larger audience - but are more accessible overall! Virtual activities can also be added to a live event, as an additional experience for your attendees!

### What are some virtual event options? 
One of the things we’ve discovered is that hosting pre-hackathon or non-hackathon events is extremely useful for everyone across the board. 
 
The [IBM Quantum Experience](http://quantum-computing.ibm.com) has opportunities to start playing around with the circuit composer, and we recommend signing up for it! Have a meetup with friends or colleagues, and explore what you might be able to do together. If you are planning on doing a hackathon, participants need to have an IBMid created in order to participate, so this is a good preceding activity.
 
Maybe the most important workshop to hold is a qiskit 101 tutorial. We [know installing and running qiskit for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4EkW4VwhcI) may be a little confusing. Having someone on site to go over the steps and then walk through a few of the [qiskit tutorials hosted on our public GitHub](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials) is a great introduction to qiskit, and can be a very educational live stream or presentation!
 
Our [Coding with Qiskit YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY), and our [open source qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/about.html) are both popular resources that people have used to help get people up to speed or familiar with Qiskit and Quantum. There are even live Q&As that are hosted by Quantum teams, that can be great opportunities for virtual viewing parties!
